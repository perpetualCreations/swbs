    Sends an acknowledgement byte string.
    Acknowledgments are used generally for confirming authentication and other specific processes (not general data transmission).
    This function is also responsible for relaying failed commands to client interface, and receiving buffer size acknowledgements.
    The latter, buffer size acknowledgements, is to make sure the host knows the length of a transmission that the client is about to send, so it can set its buffer size accordingly.

    Due to the receive function needing to send a buffer size acknowledgement, which would require an endless loop of acknowledgements for each send, acknowledgements are encoded in 4 digit number IDs.
    They are:

    Number ID: 1000
    ID: rca-1.2:connection_acknowledge
    Description: General acknowledgement or confirmation (usually during connect/disconnect).

    ###### n/a for sending as client ######
    Number ID: 2001
    ID: rca-1.2:authentication_invalid
    Description: Authentication was invalid, and was rejected by host. Check swbs.cfg on both sides to make sure authentication matches.
    ###### n/a for sending as client ######

    ###### n/a for sending as client ######
